# notes_demo

I've written this small "todo" application as an example
of what I can do with React and other modern front-end tools and technoligies.
There is nothing special, just little server-less application, which could be
used by future hirer to understand my skill level.

There is a list of technologies that I've used to build it:
- React
- Redux
- Formik
- Webpack
- Babel
- Flow
- Jest
- Reactstrap

Why have I used so many packages for so small application. There is only one answer -
just for example. To be honest I'm sure that using of these packages needed only for
really big applications.

## How to see it in work

In order to see this small application you have to install `git` and `nodejs` 
on your PC at first and then clone this repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:andreycrane/notes_demo.git
```

After you've cloned repository go to project directory

```bash
cd notes_demo
```

and install all dependencies using npm

```bash
npm i
```

When installation process will be finished you can start local server by typing next
command in terminal:

```bash
npm run server
```

After you can go to your browser and open `localhost:8080` address. That's it!
