# notes_demo

I've written this small "todo" application as an example
of what I can do with React and other modern front-end instruments.
There is nothing special, just little server-less application, which could be
used by future hirer to understand my skill level.

There is a list of technologies that I've used to build it:
- React
- Redux
- Formik
- Webpack
- Babel
- Flow

Why have I used so many packages for so small application. There is only one answer -
just for example. To be honest I'm sure that using of these packages needed only for
real big applications.
